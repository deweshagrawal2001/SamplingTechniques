# SamplingTechniquesAssignment
## Five Different Sampling techniques used are:
**1. Systematic Sampling:**
      Systematic sampling is similar to simple random sampling, but it is usually slightly easier to conduct. Every member of the population is listed with a number, but instead of randomly generating numbers, individuals are chosen at regular intervals.
      
**2. Stratified Sampling:**
      Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subpopulations that may differ in important ways.
      
**3. Simple Random Sampling:**
      In a simple random sample, every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
      
**4. Cluster Sampling:**
      Cluster sampling also involves dividing the population into subgroups, but each subgroup should have similar characteristics to the whole sample.
      
**5. Multi-Stage Sampling**
      In multistage sampling, or multistage cluster sampling, we draw a sample from a population using smaller and smaller groups (units) at each stage.


## Five Different Classification Models used are:
**1. XGBClassifier**

**2. Simple Vector Machine**

**3. Decision Tree Classifier**

**4. Gaussian Naive Bayes**

**5. LGBMClassifier**
